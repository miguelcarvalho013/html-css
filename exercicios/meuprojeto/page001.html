    <h1>this page is mainly going to talk  Joe Biden news as a president.</h1>
    <p>In May 9, President Joe Biden threatened to withhold from Israel key weapons if the Jewish state proceeded with a major invasion of Gazas southernmost city, Rafah, where Hamas retains several intact battalions. On May 10, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired back: “If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone. If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails.” Military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari affirmed that Israel “has munitions for the missions it plans, and for the missions in Rafah, too.” </p>
    <p>The prime ministers defiant rejoinder to President Biden and the admirals firm reassurance reiterated the nations traditional national security doctrine: Israel must take full responsibility for its security. It must make the final decisions about its vital national interests and the best means for advancing them. And it must fight its own battles.
        Bold words and traditional doctrines, though, should not obscure basic facts. However ill-advised Bidens threat, Israels ability to defend itself in the multi-front war launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its regional proxies depends on the United States readiness to keep Israel well-supplied with munitions and other essential military equipment.
        
        Although Israel has to an extraordinary extent since its founding fought its own battles, it never freed itself from strategic dependence on other nations. From its birth in May 1948 to the current multi-front war, the Jewish state has relied on others for crucial weapons. Still lacking 76 years after its birth a homegrown and diversified military-industrial complex, Israel imports much of its equipment – munitions, bombs and rockets, small arms, and nearly all its military aircraft – from the United States.</p>
